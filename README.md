# Codename Hydrengea
A rewrite of Vs. Floraverse; planned on being the whole mod remade in Codename Engine. 

# Changes from Vs. Floraverse Psych Engine
    - Mechanics are easier to read
    - Charts are adjusted to make more sense
    - Icons updated to look better
    
# Why the Switch?
I mainly wanted to work on coding in less harder circumstances, but also I wanted to try remaking this mod. I wasn't really happy with how it was done, and I want to update the asthetic with each week.

# Is the Scope changing?
Nope! All songs, including the bonus one in the game is going to be included. It'll also have a way to see the Pressure mechanic easier.
